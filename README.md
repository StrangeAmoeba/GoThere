##### We are live at [GoThere](www.gothere.tk)
\
Go There is a dynamic path finding and optimising application. Using parallelism at every step to ensure performace.
Essentially providing a fast approximation to the Travelling Salesman Problem.Given a set of destinations the most
effecient way to visit all of them is provided by it.

## Architecture
We have a two server architecture.
- One server running a private **Jenkins CI**.
- Another one for CD running a **dockerised** version of the application.

On pushes to **master**, jenkins runs tests and builds. If successful an image of the built app is pushed to docker hub.
The deployment server is also triggered which pulls this image from docker hub and runs the latest app live, ensuring CI and CD.

## Dependencies
There are no third party go packages being used out of the ones in this repository.
We use Google APIs for distance/traffic/map data, credentials need to be provided in ```externalApi.go``` to run.
**Jenkins** and **Docker** are used for CI/CD and containerisation.
## Instructions
To run the application do the following :
- cd into your go workspace
``` cd $GOPATH/src ```
- clone the repository
``` git clone git@github.com:IITH-SBJoshi/concurrency-9.git ```
- run the main.go
``` go run main.go ```
